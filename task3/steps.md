# Steps:

## Study the Existing Code:
  Access the uart_tx project from the [VSDSquadron_FM repository](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/tree/main/uart_tx).
  Examine the Verilog code to understand the transmission process.
## Design Documentation:
  Create a block diagram detailing the UART transmitter module.
  Develop a circuit diagram illustrating the FPGA's UART TX pin connection to the receiving device.
## Implementation:
  Assemble the hardware setup as depicted in the circuit diagram.
  Synthesize and program the FPGA with the UART transmitter code.
## Testing and Verification:
  Connect the FPGA to a PC or another UART-compatible device.
  Use a serial terminal to observe the transmitted data, ensuring accurate data transmission.
## Documentation:
  Document the block diagram, circuit diagram, code walkthrough, and testing outcomes.
  Produce a short video showcasing the UART transmission in operation.
