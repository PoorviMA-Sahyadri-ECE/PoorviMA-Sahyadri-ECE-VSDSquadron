# Steps:

## Study the Existing Code:
1. Access the uart_loopback project from the [VSDSquadron_FM repository](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/uart_loopback/uart_trx.v).
2. Analyze the Verilog code to understand the loopback logic.

---

## Design Documentation:
1. Create a block diagram illustrating the UART loopback architecture.
2. Develop a detailed circuit diagram showing connections between the FPGA and any peripheral devices used.

---

## Implementation:
1. Set up the hardware as per the circuit diagram.
2. Synthesize and upload the Verilog code to the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini.

---

## Testing and Verification:
1. Use a serial terminal to send data to the FPGA and verify that the same data is received back, confirming successful loopback.

---

## Documentation:
1. Compile the block diagram, circuit diagram, code explanations, and testing results into a comprehensive report.
2. Record a short video demonstrating the loopback functionality in action.
