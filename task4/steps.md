Steps:

Study the Existing Code:
1. Access the uart_tx_sense project from the VSDSquadron_FM repository.
2. Review the Verilog code to understand how sensor data is acquired and transmitted.

Design Documentation:
1. Create a block diagram depicting the integration of the sensor module with the UART transmitter.
2. Develop a circuit diagram showing connections between the FPGA, sensor, and the receiving device.

Implementation:
1. Set up the hardware according to the circuit diagram, ensuring proper sensor interfacing.
2. Synthesize and load the Verilog code onto the FPGA.

Testing and Verification:
1. Stimulate the sensor and observe the transmitted data on a serial terminal to verify accurate sensor data transmission.

Documentation:
1. Assemble the block diagram, circuit diagram, code analysis, and testing results into a detailed report.
2. Record a short video demonstrating the system transmitting sensor data via UART.
