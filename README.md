System-level integration with peripherals

#Project 1: UART Loopback
---
Objective
Implement a UART loopback mechanism where transmitted data is received back immediately to validate the UART block.

Description
Uses a single UART port for both TX and RX

No external hardware needed other than a USB-UART cable

Copy
Edit

Test Procedure
Connect FPGA via USB

Open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, screen)


Type characters ‚Äî same characters should echo back

Project 2: UART Transmitter
---
Objective
Develop a UART TX module that transmits constant or programmed data.

Test Procedure
Serial terminal receives data from FPGA (e.g., ‚ÄúHello UART‚Äù)
Ensure data rate, stop bits, and baud rate are matched

#Project 3: UART TX from Sensor Input
---
Objective
Transmit real-time sensor data via UART.

Hardware
Sensor (e.g., temperature or light)
FPGA board

USB-UART interface
Test
Stimulate the sensor
Observe terminal output

Project 4: UART-Controlled Display System
---
Goal
Send characters via UART and display them on a 7-segment or LCD module.
Architecture
rust
Copy
Edit
Terminal --> FPGA UART RX --> Display Decoder --> 7-Segment/LCD

Project 5: UART-Controlled Actuator System
---
Goal
Control physical components like LEDs or motors via UART commands.

Example Commands
rust
Copy
Edit
Send: "LON"  --> Turns LED ON  
Send: "LOFF" --> Turns LED OFF
Tools Used
VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board

Yosys, NextPNR, icestorm tools

GTKWave for simulation

PuTTY / Minicom for UART communication

#Demo Videos & Screenshots
---
All demonstration videos and snapshots are located in the thumbnails/ directory.

**Time	Description
0 sec	Board powered, idle state
5 sec	UART TX active (data seen)
10 sec	UART loopback verified


How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
make clean
make build
sudo make flash
screen /dev/ttyUSBx 9600  # Replace x with your device number
Ensure the device path matches your FTDI or USB-UART port.

Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Baud mismatch	Ensured UART settings matched on both sides
Loopback misread	Added debounce logic to clean noise
Sensor fluctuation	Averaging filter applied before UART TX
